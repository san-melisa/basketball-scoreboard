# Scoreboard Project
This project is an interactive scoreboard built based on a [Figma design]([Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/design/YC48MCx4frBFtYoz6rNJE6/Basketball-Scoreboard?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=1Kcb0V66rv4JH7uf-0)). You can view the live project [here]([Project Link](https://basketball-scrboard.netlify.app/)).

## About The Project
I first recreated the design with HTML and CSS to create a pixel-perfect user interface. Then, I added core functionality with JavaScript to manage and reset scores, making the scoreboard fully functional.

Features
* HTML & CSS: A pixel-perfect user interface faithful to the Figma design.

* JavaScript: Functionality to increase and reset scores.
